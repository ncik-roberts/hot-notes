# HOT Compilation (15-417), Spring 2018

I've decided to uphold the tradition of starting, but not finishing, typesetting the notes
for this class. Mistakes are mine, and numerous. My incoherent remarks are intertwined with
the lecture material to create a colorful tapestry.

These notes include no more SML code than what was presented in lecture, and I've tried to
keep my comments about the assignments limited to what the professor says.
